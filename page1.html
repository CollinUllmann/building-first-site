            <H2>The Problem</H2>
            <p>In the vibrant Magic: the Gathering community, assessing the true worth of a Commander list involves more than just gauging its power level. It's about striking a harmonious balance between the tried-and-true staples and those hidden gems, those cherished pet cards that make each deck unique. This complexity often leaves players grappling with the challenge of evaluating decks beyond their sheer strength, making it a daunting task to find that perfect blend of power and personality.</p>

            <H2>Enter CAYENNE</H2>
            <p>Project CAYENNE aspires to be the definitive solution. It diligently collects and processes data from the most esteemed deck-building resources within the Magic community. What sets CAYENNE apart is its ability to do more than just count card appearances. It interprets the intricate web of relationships between commanders, cards, and synergies. By assessing not only how often a card appears generally but also how frequently it's seen alongside particular commanders and in combination with other cards, CAYENNE generates a clear and accessible score. This score offers players an easy-to-digest understanding of how a game between two decks might unfold, bridging the gap between data-driven evaluation and the visceral experience of a Commander showdown.</p>
